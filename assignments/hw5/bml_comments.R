1. For what values of p, the density of the grid, did you ???nd free ???owing tra???c and 
tra???c jams? Did you ???nd any cases of a mixture of jams and free ???owing tra???c?
 
  I found that from 0 to .4, the grid was generally free of traffic jam. 
  From .6 to 1, the grid generally experienced traffic jams.

2. How many simulation steps did you need to run before observing this behavior?

  I ran the steps about 10000 times, before concluding that the grid did not experience 
  traffic jams. Most number of steps before experiencing a traffic jams 

3. Does the transition depend on the size or shape of the grid?

  The bigger the size ofthe grid, the more traffic jams that occur. 
  The more square the grid is, there are less traffic jams.
